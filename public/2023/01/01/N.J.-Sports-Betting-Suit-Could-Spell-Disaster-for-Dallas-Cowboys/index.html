Sports Betting Suit Could Spell Disaster for Dallas Cowboys"></a>N.J. Sports Betting Suit Could Spell Disaster for Dallas Cowboys</h1><p>The New Jersey sports betting suit that was argued in the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, Dec. 4 could spell disaster for the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>The state of New Jersey is hoping to overturn a 26-year-old federal law that bans sports betting in all but four states. If New Jersey is successful, it could open up the floodgates for other states to legalize sports betting, which would have a devastating impact on the NFL, as well as other professional sports leagues.</p>
<p>While the NFL and other leagues have been fighting to keep sports betting illegal, they have done very little to address the issue of gambling addiction. The NFL has long claimed that it is a “family friendly” organization, but with its Rams moving back to Los Angeles and $4 billion in annual profits, it’s clear that the league is more interested in making money than protecting its fans.</p>
<p>If New Jersey wins its lawsuit, it will be up to the individual states to decide whether or not to legalize sports betting. This could lead to a hodgepodge of different rules and regulations governing sports betting across the country. It would be extremely difficult for the NFL or any other professional sports league to enforce their rules and protect their fans if they are operating in a state where sports betting is legal while another state has a ban on gambling.</p>
<p>The NFL has already suffered from legalized gambling in Nevada. In 2011, nearly $3 billion was wagered on NFL games in Nevada, and about $100 million of that was wagered on Cowboys games alone. If New Jersey is successful in overturning the federal law banning sports betting, it’s likely that many more states will legalize gambling, which would be disastrous for the NFL and other professional sports leagues.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Gambling-on-the-New-Jersey-Sports-Betting-Suit-a-Risk-Worth-Taking-for-Dallas-Cowboys"><a href="#Is-Gambling-on-the-New-Jersey-Sports-Betting-Suit-a-Risk-Worth-Taking-for-Dallas-Cowboys" class="headerlink" title="Is Gambling on the New Jersey Sports Betting Suit a Risk Worth Taking for Dallas Cowboys?"></a>Is Gambling on the New Jersey Sports Betting Suit a Risk Worth Taking for Dallas Cowboys?</h1><p>The Dallas Cowboys are among the NFL teams considering a legal challenge to overturn the Federal law that bans gambling on sports.</p>
<p>On Monday, November 13th, Reuters reported that a group of six NFL teams, including the Cowboys and Detroit Lions, are exploring the possibility of filing a lawsuit to overturn a 1992 federal law that bans sports betting in all but four states.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Cowboys and Lions both declined to comment on the story.</p>
<p>While this may seem like a risky move for teams, there are a few reasons why it could be worth it for them to pursue this case.</p>
<p>First of all, as Reuters points out, there is some precedent for this sort of thing. In 2014, the NBA successfully challenged a federal law that banned sports gambling in most states.</p>
<p>That case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the NBA. Since then, several other leagues have also pursued similar cases.</p>
<p>Another reason why it might make sense for NFL teams to pursue this case is because public opinion is shifting on the issue of gambling. A recent poll from Morning Consult found that nearly two-thirds of Americans support legalizing sports betting.</p>
<p>This number is likely even higher among NFL fans and could help sway court decisions in favor of gambling legalization. Finally, there is also money at stake here. The American Gaming Association estimates that legalized sports betting could generate up to $25 billion in annual revenue. This could be a major boon for NFL teams and help offset some of the financial losses they’ve been experiencing in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="Will-NJ-Sports-Betting-Suit-Impact-Dallas-Cowboys’-Season"><a href="#Will-NJ-Sports-Betting-Suit-Impact-Dallas-Cowboys’-Season" class="headerlink" title="Will NJ Sports Betting Suit Impact Dallas Cowboys’ Season?"></a>Will NJ Sports Betting Suit Impact Dallas Cowboys’ Season?</h1><p>Dallas Cowboys fans have mixed opinions as to how the NFL’s ruling on New Jersey’s sports betting lawsuit will impact their favorite team this season. Those in support of sports betting believe that the Cowboys will now have an advantage over their opponents, as they will be able to place insider bets on their own games. Detractors of sports betting argue that the addition of this distraction will only serve to further derail America’s most popular sport.</p>
<p>No matter one’s opinion on the matter, there is no doubt that the NFL’s decision will have a significant impact on both New Jersey and Dallas Cowboys moving forward. Sports betting is now officially legal in NJ, while the Cowboys must now compete with 28 other teams for a chance at the Super Bowl.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey’s-Sports-Betting-Suit-Could-Spell-Trouble-for-Dallas-Cowboys"><a href="#New-Jersey’s-Sports-Betting-Suit-Could-Spell-Trouble-for-Dallas-Cowboys" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey’s Sports Betting Suit Could Spell Trouble for Dallas Cowboys"></a>New Jersey’s Sports Betting Suit Could Spell Trouble for Dallas Cowboys</h1><p>The New Jersey gambling case that started in 2014 is finally reaching a verdict. On Monday, the Supreme Court released its opinion in the case, which stated that the Federal law prohibiting sports betting is unconstitutional. This now paves the way for all states to legalize gambling on sporting events.</p>
<p>While this ruling affects all states, it could spell trouble for The Dallas Cowboys. New Jersey argued that the Federal law prohibiting sports betting violated their 10th amendment rights by preventing them from regulating a form of gambling within their state. This means that other states could make a similar argument to legalize sports betting, which would include professional teams like The Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>There are many potential implications of this ruling for The Dallas Cowboys. For example, if other states are able to legalize sports betting, it could lead to an increase in illegal gambling on Cowboys games. This could result in decreased attendance at Cowboys games and less money being generated from television contracts and other sources of revenue. In addition, if legalized sports gambling becomes more widespread, it could lead to more corruption in professional sports.</p>
<p>While it is still too early to know the full implications of this ruling, it is clear that it could have a significant impact on The Dallas Cowboys and other professional teams.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Sports-Betting-Lawsuit-Could-Derail-Dallas-Cowboys"><a href="#NJ-Sports-Betting-Lawsuit-Could-Derail-Dallas-Cowboys" class="headerlink" title="NJ Sports Betting Lawsuit Could Derail Dallas Cowboys"></a>NJ Sports Betting Lawsuit Could Derail Dallas Cowboys</h1><p>The stakes are high in the New Jersey sports betting lawsuit, as it may soon determine the fate of the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>As we all know, the NFL is a major sports league with teams spread out across the United States. And, of course, with such a large and popular sport comes vast amounts of money. Recently, though, one state has decided to try and get a piece of that lucrative pie: New Jersey.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been trying to legalize sports betting for years now, but the major leagues (including the NFL) have fought back tooth and nail. That is, until now. A recent ruling by the Supreme Court seems to signal that New Jersey may finally win this fight – which could have massive implications for both the NFL and its teams.</p>
<p>If New Jersey is successful in legalizing sports betting, it could open up a huge new market for the NFL. Casinos and other gambling establishments would be likely to start taking bets on NFL games, and that could lead to some serious profits for the league. Additionally, it would likely also increase viewership (and thus advertising revenue) as people tune in to see how their bets are doing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if New Jersey loses its case there could be serious implications for some NFL teams – especially those located in states where gambling is currently banned. For example, if people are no longer able to bet on games in Texas then that could significantly hurt the Dallas Cowboys’ bottom line. In fact, it’s possible that some teams might even relocate if their state starts allowing gambling but they don’t want to be associated with it.</p>
<p>At this point it’s still unclear how things will play out in New Jersey’s lawsuit against the major leagues. However, what is clear is that this case will have a significant impact on both the NFL and its teams – for better or for worse</p>
