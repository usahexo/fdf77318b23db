It is a mount that is ridden by the Warrior of Light. This guide will give you a few tips on how to unlock it.</p>
<p>To start your journey, you will first need to reach level 70 with at least one class or job. Once you have reached the required level, you must then complete the main scenario quest “Soul Without Life” which can be started by talking to Baptiste in Ul’dah - Steps of Nald. After completing this quest, you will then be able to queue for The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard) dungeon through the Duty Finder under the Leveling tab.</p>
<p>The dungeon can be completed on any difficulty but it is recommended that you attempt it on hard mode as this is where Nietzsche can be obtained as a reward. Be sure to also set your loot rules to Personal before starting the dungeon as there is a high chance of obtaining Nietzche upon completion.</p>
<p>After defeating the final boss in The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard), speak with Gibrillont who can be found nearby and he will award you with the much sought after mount. Congratulations! You have now unlocked Nietzsche in Final Fantasy XIV!</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Unlock-All-Duty-Roulette-Zoe-In-FFXIV"><a href="#How-To-Unlock-All-Duty-Roulette-Zoe-In-FFXIV" class="headerlink" title="How To Unlock All Duty Roulette Zoë In FFXIV"></a>How To Unlock All Duty Roulette Zoë In FFXIV</h1><p>There are many people who want to unlock all the duties in Duty Roulette: Zoë but they don’t know how. So, I am here to tell you how to do it. The process is actually quite simple and only requires a few steps.</p>
<p>The first step is to talk to Zoë in Rhalgr’s Reach (X:13.8, Y:12.5). She can be found next to the entrance of the Ala Mhigan stronghold. Once you have spoken to her, she will give you a token that you can use to queue for any duty in Duty Roulette: Zoë.</p>
<p>The second step is to complete the following three levequests:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Walk on the Wild Side ( Disciple of War or Magic level 43)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Speak with Valaineral at Revenant’s Toll (X:6.1, Y:12.4)</li>
<li>Slay 10 Elementals at Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)</li>
<li>Collect 5 Water Elementals’ Totems from Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Fisher of Men ( Disciple of War or Magic level 47)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Speak with Halone at Camp Bronze Lake (X:6.8, Y:11.4)</li>
<li>Hunt 200 Great Yellowfins in Western La Noscea (X:21.7, Y:32.0)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Last Step? ( Disciple of War or Magic level 50) - Speak with Midiamorphe at Idyllshire (X:5.9, Y:8.2) - Defeat 3 non-elite Primals without taking damage - Talk to Midiamorphe again</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have completed these levequests, return to Zoë and she will give you the rewards for unlocking all the duties in Duty Roulette: Zoë</p>
<h1 id="FFXIV-How-To-Get-All-12-Duty-Roulette-Tokens"><a href="#FFXIV-How-To-Get-All-12-Duty-Roulette-Tokens" class="headerlink" title="FFXIV How To Get All 12 Duty Roulette Tokens"></a>FFXIV How To Get All 12 Duty Roulette Tokens</h1><p>FFXIV fans who want to get all 12 Duty Roulette tokens will need to complete the following tasks.</p>
<p>Complete the main scenario quests and Palace of the Dead up to floor 20. Defeat Ifrit, Garuda, Titan, and Ramuh in their respective trials. Defeat Alexander in the Alexander raid.</p>
<p>Once these steps have been completed, players can start undertaking the duties associated with the Duties Roulette: Heavensward (Extreme) and Duties Roulette: Final Fantasy XIV. Players who complete these duties will be rewarded with a token that can be used to summon one of the Primals found in the trial for that week.</p>
<h1 id="Solve-The-Riddle-And-Unlock-Duty-Roulette-Zoe-In-FFXIV"><a href="#Solve-The-Riddle-And-Unlock-Duty-Roulette-Zoe-In-FFXIV" class="headerlink" title="Solve The Riddle And Unlock Duty Roulette Zoë In FFXIV"></a>Solve The Riddle And Unlock Duty Roulette Zoë In FFXIV</h1><p>Duty Roulette Zoë is a new feature in Final Fantasy XIV that was added in patch 4.4. It is an extension of the Duty Roulette system and rewards players for completing random dungeons and trials.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Talk to Sagittarius in Central Shroud at X:20.9 Y:11.4. He will give you a riddle to solve.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The answer to the riddle is “the moon.”</p>

</ol>
<h1 id="Final-Fantasy-XIV-How-To-Unlock-The-Just-About-All-Duty-Roulette-Locations"><a href="#Final-Fantasy-XIV-How-To-Unlock-The-Just-About-All-Duty-Roulette-Locations" class="headerlink" title="Final Fantasy XIV - How To Unlock The Just About All Duty Roulette Locations"></a>Final Fantasy XIV - How To Unlock The Just About All Duty Roulette Locations</h1><p>In Final Fantasy XIV each player is allotted with a variety of tasks they are able to do like duties, raids, FATEs and treasure hunts. The player can increase their progress speed by undertaking these type of tasks in groups. While all the dungeons and such are obtainable solo there’s undoubtedly an increased EXP (experience) and rewards return rate whenever players tackle these challenges as group.</p>
<p>In case you’re a newbie adventurer there are a couple locations which can be unlocked by undertaking the “Unlocking All Areas” mission for your class guild. The best way to get hold of this quest is speak to the various guild NPCs in your starting city - for instance, The Explorer’s Guild for Disciples of the Land characters.</p>
<p>Once you complete the prerequisite class story quests you will automatically be given this particular quest. After that it is simply a question of heading out and unlocking all Duty Roulette instances (which I will cover below).</p>
<p>Duty Roulette is definitely an awesome means of getting loot and EXP quickly. By simply cycling through different instances you’ll be able to rack up rewards rapidly. That said though - it can be a little daunting for newcomers when it comes to figuring out where to start. This is especially true if you’re not familiar with the game world or its layout.</p>
<p>Lucky for you, I am here to offer some guidance! In this article I will show you how to unlock all Duty Roulette Locations - so read on!</p>
<p>FFXIV Duty Roulette Unlock Locations: Tips For Newcomers &amp; veterans Alike! </p>
<p>  There are several Duty Roulette instances available in Final Fantasy XIV, but unlocking them all can be a little daunting for newcomers. This guide offers tips on how unlock all Duty Roulette Locations easily and efficiently!  </p>
<p>  First things first: what exactly is Duty Roulette? Simply put, Duty Roulette is a means of speeding up your progress by undertaking random dungeon/raid challenges with others players instead of tackling them alone. There’s an increased EXP and rewards rate when completing these challenges as part of a group - so it’s well worth doing!  </p>
<p>  Now that we know what Duty Roulette is, let’s take a look at how to unlock all its instances. There are six total Duty Roulettes available in FFXIV: three raids (Alexander - The Ridorana Lighthouse; Omega - Sigmascape V4S; Ultima Weapon), two dungeons (The Lost City of Amdapor; Saint Mocianne’s Arboretum), and one FATE location (The Swallows). None of these are particularly difficult to unlock - it just takes some time and effort. </p>
<p>  For starters, let’s take a look at the easiest instance to unlock: The Lost City of Amdapor dungeon. To open up this particular instance, players must first complete the main story quests for level 50 Disciples of War or Magic characters. After that, players must complete the “Unlocking All Areas” mission which can be obtained from the respective class guilds in each city-state starting area (e.g., The Explorer’s Guild NPC in Gridania for Disciples of Land job classes). Once players have completed both these steps they will then have access to The Lost City of Amdapor duty roulette challenge! Easy enough, right? </p>
<p>  Saint Mocianne’s Arboretum dungeon is unlocked in a very similar fashion: by completing the prerequisite story quests for level 50 Disciples of War or Magic characters and then completing the “Unlocking All Areas” mission from their respective class guilds. However, there is one small difference: players must also possess at least one relic weapon in order to gain access to Saint Mocianne’s Arboretum duty roulette challenge. No biggie though - most players will likely have obtained at least one relic weapon by this point in the game! </p>
<p> Having trouble locating your class guild? Don’t worry - I’ve got you covered! Check out my handy guide below on where each class guild can be found in each starting city-state:  Gridania: Archer | Black Mage | Botanist | Gladiator | Lancer | Monk | Ninja | Paladin | Priest | Rogue | Scholar | Summoner | Warrior Limsa Lominsa: Bard | Dragoon | Fisher | Marauder | Monk | Pugilist | Rogue | Thaumaturge Ul’dah: Alchemist | Astrologian| Conjurer| Dark Knight|Dragoon| Fisher| Gladiator| Lancer| Machinist| Monk| NINJA| Paladin| Scholar| Summoner</p>
