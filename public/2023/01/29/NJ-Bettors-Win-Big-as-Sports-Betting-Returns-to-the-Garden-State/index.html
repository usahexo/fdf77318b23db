<p>According to figures released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE), over $16.4 million was wagered on sports in the first week of operations, with over $3.8 million being paid out in winnings.</p>
<p>This represented a near-doubling of the handle from Nevada’s first week of legal sports betting in 1949, when $8.5 million was wagered.</p>
<p>And while New Jersey won’t come close to matching Nevada’s overall annual sports betting revenue – which reached nearly $5 billion last year – the early returns suggest that the Garden State could quickly become a major player in the industry.</p>
<p>The biggest winners so far have been NJ bettors themselves, who have cashed in on some big upsets and underdog victories. On September 17th alone, $1 million was paid out in winnings on bets placed at Monmouth Park Racetrack.</p>
<p>The returns have been so good that many Atlantic City casinos are now offering reduced juice – or better odds for players – on select games in an effort to attract more business.</p>
<p>Casino executives say they are thrilled with how things have started off, and that they are looking forward to a bright future for sports betting in New Jersey.</p>
<p>“We believe this is just the beginning for New Jersey gaming and look forward to continued success,” said Dennis Gomes, co-chairman of Ocean Resort Casino.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Sports-Betting-Offers-Hope-for-Bettors-Looking-to-Profit"><a href="#NJ-Sports-Betting-Offers-Hope-for-Bettors-Looking-to-Profit" class="headerlink" title="NJ Sports Betting Offers Hope for Bettors Looking to Profit"></a>NJ Sports Betting Offers Hope for Bettors Looking to Profit</h1><p>New Jersey has finally legalized sports betting, giving residents and visitors a chance to profit off of their knowledge of the game. There are many ways to bet on sports, and each offers its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Point spreads are probably the most common type of bet. In this type of wager, you gamble that one team will beat the other by a certain number of points. This can be a great way to make money if you have a strong opinion about which team is going to win. For example, if you think that the Cleveland Cavaliers are going to beat the Golden State Warriors by more than 10 points, then you can place a bet on them and make some money.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure who is going to win, you can also bet on the point spread in order to reduce your risk. In this case, you would wager that the two teams will finish with a margin of victory within a certain range. For example, if you think that the Cavs might only beat the Warriors by 5 or 6 points, then you could bet on them with this spread. This would allow you to make money even if your original pick loses, as long as they don’t lose by too many points.</p>
<p>Another common type of sports bet is known as a money line bet. With this wager, you simply pick which team is going to win the game outright. This can be a great option for people who are looking for a high-risk, high-reward gamble. For example, if you think that the New York Yankees are going to beat the Boston Red Sox by 8 or more runs, then you could place a money line bet on them and potentially make a lot of money. However, if they only win by 7 runs or less, then you would lose your entire wager.</p>
<p>Parlay bets are another popular option for sports betting fans. In this type of wager, you combine two or more bets into one larger gamble. If all of your picks win, then you can earn a large payout. However, if even one selection loses then your entire bet is lost. This can be an exciting way to make some serious money if all of your predictions come true – but it can also lead to disaster if things don’t go according to plan.</p>
<p>No matter which type of sport betting appeals to you most, it’s important to do your research before placing any wagers. Make sure that you know as much as possible about all of the teams involved and their relative odds of winning. By doing your homework ahead of time, you can give yourself the best chance at winning big bucks while watching your favorite sporting event!</p>
<h1 id="Bettors-in-NJ-Gather-at-Local-Sportsbooks-to-Place-Bets-on-Their-Favorite-Teams"><a href="#Bettors-in-NJ-Gather-at-Local-Sportsbooks-to-Place-Bets-on-Their-Favorite-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Bettors in NJ Gather at Local Sportsbooks to Place Bets on Their Favorite Teams"></a>Bettors in NJ Gather at Local Sportsbooks to Place Bets on Their Favorite Teams</h1><p>The NFL season is in full swing and for football fans in New Jersey, that means one thing: it’s time to place some bets.</p>
<p>Bettors in the state have been flocking to local sportsbooks to make wagers on their favorite teams. In fact, business has been so good that some casinos are having a hard time keeping up with demand.</p>
<p>At the Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa in Atlantic City, for example, people have been lining up to place bets at the sportsbook window. The casino has even had to set up a temporary betting location outside of the building just to keep up with demand.</p>
<p>“The NFL is always a big draw, but this year seems to be especially popular,” said Joe Lupo, senior vice president of marketing at the Borgata. “We’ve seen a surge in volume and we expect it to continue as the season progresses.”</p>
<p>Casinos aren’t the only ones benefiting from the surge in betting activity. Delaware Park Resort &amp; Casino recorded its single-highest day ever on September 8th – just one day after the start of the NFL season. Officials at the casino report that they took in more than $2 million in bets on that one day alone.</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently legal in New Jersey and Delaware, as well as a few other states. But that could soon change. The US Supreme Court is expected to rule later this year on whether or not to overturn a law that bans most forms of sports betting nationwide. If that law is overturned, it could create a boom in the sports betting industry and bring billions of dollars into state coffers each year.</p>
<h1 id="Increased-Competition-Leads-to-Greater-Opportunities-for-NJ-Bettors"><a href="#Increased-Competition-Leads-to-Greater-Opportunities-for-NJ-Bettors" class="headerlink" title="Increased Competition Leads to Greater Opportunities for NJ Bettors"></a>Increased Competition Leads to Greater Opportunities for NJ Bettors</h1><p>The US Supreme Court’s recent ruling in the Murphy v. NCAA case has essentially legalized sports betting across the entire country. This is great news for New Jersey bettors, who will now have a huge range of legal betting options available to them.</p>
<p>Prior to the Supreme Court’s ruling, Nevada was the only state where sports betting was legal. This meant that New Jersey residents had to travel to Las Vegas or use an offshore gambling site if they wanted to bet on sporting events. Now that sports betting is legal in all 50 states, New Jersey residents can place bets right from their smartphones or computers.</p>
<p>This increased competition is sure to lead to better odds and bigger payouts for NJ bettors. In addition, it will also create new job opportunities in the online gambling industry. With so many legal betting options now available, there has never been a better time to be a New Jersey sports gambler.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Bettors-Expected-to-Benefit-from-Changes-in-Legal-Landscape"><a href="#NJ-Bettors-Expected-to-Benefit-from-Changes-in-Legal-Landscape" class="headerlink" title="NJ Bettors Expected to Benefit from Changes in Legal Landscape"></a>NJ Bettors Expected to Benefit from Changes in Legal Landscape</h1><p>According to a report from NJ.com, New Jersey residents who enjoy betting on sports are expected to reap the benefits of recent changes in the legal landscape. New legislation that has been signed into law by Governor Phil Murphy will allow for the operation of sports betting services at casinos and racetracks in the state.</p>
<p>The new law is a result of a Supreme Court ruling from May 2018, which struck down a federal ban on sports betting. This opened the door for states to legislate their own rules regarding the activity, and NJ is now one of several states that have taken advantage of this opportunity.</p>
<p>There has been some speculation that there may be an influx of illegal bookmaking operations in NJ in light of the new law. However, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal has said that his office is prepared to crack down on any such activity.</p>
<p>Sports betting is expected to generate significant revenue for the state of NJ. According to an estimate from Econsult Solutions, it could bring in as much as $500 million in its first year alone. This would help offset some of the revenue losses that have been caused by the state’s high taxes.</p>
<p>Governor Murphy has expressed enthusiasm for the new law, and he believes that it will create jobs and economic opportunities in NJ. He also anticipates that it will attract tourists to the state.</p>
<p>While there has been some opposition to the new law, most people seem to agree that it is a positive development for NJ. John Brennan, who is president of the Meadowlands Racetrack, said that “This is great news for New Jersey and its economy.”</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how things play out in NJ as sports betting becomes more prevalent. It seems likely that this will be a boon for both casinos and racetracks in the state, as well as for taxpayers overall</p>
