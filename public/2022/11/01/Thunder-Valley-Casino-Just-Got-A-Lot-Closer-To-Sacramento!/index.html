<p>Earlier this year, the Thunder Valley Casino Resort announced that it had purchased the shuttered Royal River Casino in Folsom, and would be reopening it as the Thunder Valley Casino Sacramento. Now, it looks like they are getting closer to making that dream a reality.</p>
<p>The Thunder Valley Casio sacramento is set to open in 2020, and will include a hotel, restaurants, and of course, a casino. The new location is expected to bring in an additional 1 million visitors each year, and will create over 1,000 jobs.</p>
<p>“This is an important step in our goal of becoming Northern California’s premier destination for gaming and entertainment” said Tad timidler, CEO of the Thunder Valley Casino Resort.</p>
<p>Thunder Valley isn’t the only casino looking to expand its reach into Sacramento. Earlier this year, the Golden 1 Center – home of the Sacramento Kings – announced that it would be opening a new casino called Hollywood Casino at Sacramento. The Hollywood Casino at Sacramento is set to open in 2019 and will include 2,000 slot machines and 50 table games.</p>

<h1 id="Thunder-Valley-Casino-Now-Just-3301-Arena-Blvd-Away-From-Sacramento"><a href="#Thunder-Valley-Casino-Now-Just-3301-Arena-Blvd-Away-From-Sacramento" class="headerlink" title="Thunder Valley Casino Now Just 3301 Arena Blvd Away From Sacramento!"></a>Thunder Valley Casino Now Just 3301 Arena Blvd Away From Sacramento!</h1><p>The Thunder Valley Casino Resort just got a lot closer to Sacramento!

The casino is now just 3301 Arena Boulevard away from the state capital and will likely be a popular destination for those looking to gamble and enjoy a night out.</p>
<p>The announcement of the new location comes as good news to many who were hoping that the casino would expand its services to the Sacramento area.Thunder Valley Casino Resort already has a significant presence in Placer County, with over 2,500 slot machines and 78 table games. The new location will offer the same gaming options, as well as a variety of food and beverage options.</p>
