<h1 id="Table-Mountain-Casino-A-Major-Addition-to-Pennsylvania’s-Gambling-Scene"><a href="#Table-Mountain-Casino-A-Major-Addition-to-Pennsylvania’s-Gambling-Scene" class="headerlink" title="Table Mountain Casino: A Major Addition to Pennsylvania’s Gambling Scene!"></a>Table Mountain Casino: A Major Addition to Pennsylvania’s Gambling Scene!</h1><p>Pennsylvania’s gambling scene is about to get a lot more exciting with the addition of Table Mountain Casino! This new casino is scheduled to open in 2018 and will offer a variety of gaming options, including slots, table games, poker, and bingo.</p>
<p>Table Mountain Casino is being built in Schuylkill County, which is located in the heart of Pennsylvania’s coal region. The casino will be owned and operated by Philadelphia-based developer Louis DeNaples. DeNaples is no stranger to the casino industry; he also owns and operates Mount Airy Casino Resort in Monroe County.</p>
<p>The Table Mountain Casino project has been in the works for several years and has faced some delays along the way. But now that ground has finally been broken, construction is moving ahead at full speed. The new casino is expected to create over 1,000 jobs and pump millions of dollars into the local economy.</p>
<p>So what can players expect at Table Mountain Casino? The facility will have a total of 1,500 slot machines, 60 table games, a 14-table poker room, and a 5,000-square-foot bingo hall. There will also be a variety of restaurants and bars on site, as well as a 300-room hotel.</p>
<p>Schuylkill County has been without a casino since 2014, when the Hollywood Casino in Perryville closed its doors. Table Mountain Casino is expected to fill that void and provide much-needed jobs and economic stimulus to the region. So if you’re looking for an exciting new gambling destination, be sure to put Table Mountain Casino on your list!</p>
