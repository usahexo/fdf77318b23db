<h1 id="Detroit-Pistons-Host-Baccarat-Bash-This-Saturday-Night"><a href="#Detroit-Pistons-Host-Baccarat-Bash-This-Saturday-Night" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Pistons Host Baccarat Bash This Saturday Night"></a>Detroit Pistons Host Baccarat Bash This Saturday Night</h1><p>The Detroit Pistons are hosting their 2nd annual Baccarat Bash this Saturday, March 3rd at 7pm.

<h1 id="Detroit-Pistons-Ready-To-Take-On-Bucks-In-Baccarat-Matchup"><a href="#Detroit-Pistons-Ready-To-Take-On-Bucks-In-Baccarat-Matchup" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Pistons Ready To Take On Bucks In Baccarat Matchup"></a>Detroit Pistons Ready To Take On Bucks In Baccarat Matchup</h1><p>While the Detroit Pistons may be a little underrated in the NBA Eastern Conference this season, they are still a force to be reckoned with. This was certainly evident in their most recent matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks, where they came out on top with a final score of 102-86. </p>
<p>Now, as they prepare to take on the Bucks once again, this time in a baccarat matchup, many are wondering if the Bucks will be able to put up a better fight. In their first matchup, Milwaukee just wasn’t able to keep up with Detroit’s scoring power. </p>
<p>To win this time around, Milwaukee is going to need to find ways to shut down Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond. These two have been leading the Pistons offensively this season, and they were simply too much for Milwaukee to handle in their last matchup. If Griffin and Drummond can continue putting up big numbers, Detroit is likely going to come out on top once again. </p>
<p>That said, Milwaukee does have some weapons of their own that could help them pull off an upset. Giannis Antetokounmpo is always a threat to put up big numbers, and he will definitely need to be at his best if the Bucks want to win. Additionally, Eric Bledsoe has been having a strong season so far and could potentially cause some problems for Detroit. </p>
<p>In the end though, it seems likely that Detroit will come out on top in this matchup. They have been playing very well lately and seem poised to make a playoff run this season. Milwaukee may put up more of a fight than they did in their last matchup, but it’s still hard to see them winning this one.</p>
<h1 id="Detroit-Pistons-Travel-To-Cleveland-To-Face-Cavaliers-In-Baccarat-Game"><a href="#Detroit-Pistons-Travel-To-Cleveland-To-Face-Cavaliers-In-Baccarat-Game" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Pistons Travel To Cleveland To Face Cavaliers In Baccarat Game"></a>Detroit Pistons Travel To Cleveland To Face Cavaliers In Baccarat Game</h1><p>The Detroit Pistons are in Cleveland to take on the Cavaliers in a baccarat game.</p>
<p>Both teams have had somewhat disappointing seasons, but the Cavaliers are still in playoff contention. The Pistons are likely headed for a top five pick in this year’s draft.</p>
<p>The Cavaliers come into this game averaging 108.7 points per game while allowing 106.5 points per game. They are led by LeBron James, who is averaging 27.4 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 9.1 assists per game this season. Other players that contribute for the Cavaliers include Kevin Love (18.9 points and 10.2 rebounds per game) and George Hill (10.3 points per game).</p>
<p>The Pistons come into this game averaging 104 points per game while allowing 108 points per game. They are led by Blake Griffin (25 points and 7.5 rebounds per game) and Andre Drummond (15 points and 16 rebounds per game). Other players that contribute for the Pistons include Reggie Jackson (14 points per game) and Ish Smith (8 points and 4 assists per game).</p>
<p>This should be a competitive matchup between two teams that need a win to boost their morale heading into the offseason. Look for LeBron James to carry the Cavaliers to victory while Blake Griffin leads the Pistons to a close loss.</p>
<h1 id="Detroit-Pistons-Looking-For-Third-Win-In-A-Row-Over-Milwaukee-Bucks-In-Baccarat"><a href="#Detroit-Pistons-Looking-For-Third-Win-In-A-Row-Over-Milwaukee-Bucks-In-Baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Pistons Looking For Third Win In A Row Over Milwaukee Bucks In Baccarat"></a>Detroit Pistons Looking For Third Win In A Row Over Milwaukee Bucks In Baccarat</h1><p>Detroit Pistons will be aiming to win their third game in a row over Milwaukee Bucks when they meet for the second time in Baccarat. The first meeting between these two teams this season ended up in a 129-121 victory for Detroit Pistons.</p>
<p>The Bucks are coming into this matchup after winning six of their last seven games, including Wednesday night’s 117-106 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 32 points on 14-of-20 shooting, 11 rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block in 36 minutes. Khris Middleton added 26 points on 9-of-17 shooting, 10 rebounds, five assists and two steals in 36 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pistons have won three of their last four games and come into this matchup off a 111-107 victory over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. Blake Griffin led Detroit with 27 points on 11-of-19 shooting, 12 rebounds, six assists and one steal in 34 minutes. Reggie Jackson added 23 points on 10-of-16 shooting, four rebounds, six assists and one steal in 33 minutes off the bench.</p>
<p>These two teams met just once last season with the Pistons winning that matchup 119-103. Griffin led Detroit with 28 points on 11-of-17 shooting, 10 rebounds, six assists and one steal in 30 minutes. Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee with 24 points on 9-of-18 shooting, 13 rebounds, eight assists and two blocks in 36 minutes.</p>
<p>The Bucks are -2 favorites to win this game straight up according to MyBookie Sportsbook . The OVER/UNDER is set at 226 points .</p>
