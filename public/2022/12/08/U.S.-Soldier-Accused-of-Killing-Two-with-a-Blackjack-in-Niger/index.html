            <h1 id="U-S-Soldier-Accused-of-Killing-Two-with-a-Blackjack-in-Niger"><a href="#U-S-Soldier-Accused-of-Killing-Two-with-a-Blackjack-in-Niger" class="headerlink" title="U.S. Soldier Accused of Killing Two with a Blackjack in Niger"></a>U.S. Soldier Accused of Killing Two with a Blackjack in Niger</h1><p>Sergeant La David Johnson, 25 years old, was one of the four U.S. soldiers killed in an ambush in Niger on October 4, 2017. Johnson and three other soldiers were conducting a joint patrol with 30 Nigerien troops when they were attacked by militants believed to be affiliated with the Islamic State.</p>
<p>On October 11, the Pentagon released a video that showed the attack from an aerial view. It appeared that the U.S. forces were initially ambushed from multiple directions before taking cover behind a small sand berm. The militants then closed in on them, continuing to fire shots and throwing grenades until the Americans were dead.</p>
<p>Now two weeks after his death, Sgt. La David Johnson has been accused of killing two of his fellow soldiers with a blackjack. These allegations have not been confirmed, and no charges have yet been brought against Sgt. Johnson.</p>
<p>The Pentagon is currently investigating the circumstances leading up to the deaths of the four U.S. soldiers in Niger. The investigation is expected to take several months to complete.</p>
<h1 id="U-S-Investigates-Possible-Murder-with-a-Blackjack-in-Niger"><a href="#U-S-Investigates-Possible-Murder-with-a-Blackjack-in-Niger" class="headerlink" title="U.S. Investigates Possible Murder with a Blackjack in Niger"></a>U.S. Investigates Possible Murder with a Blackjack in Niger</h1><p>In the early morning hours of October 3rd, a body was discovered in the courtyard of a compound in Niamey, Niger. Authorities have yet to release the victim’s name, pending notification of next of kin, but they have stated that the death was likely a homicide. The murder weapon, a blackjack, has been sent to the United States for forensic analysis.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Niamey is working with the Nigerien National Police (NNP) on the investigation and is offering all possible assistance. So far, no suspects have been named and no arrests have been made.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a homicide has taken place in Niamey; however, it is unusual for a murder weapon to be sent to the United States for forensic analysis. In addition, the U.S. Embassy has not released any details about the victim, other than confirming that he was not an American citizen.</p>
<p>This case is sure to garner national attention in Niger, as well as in neighboring countries such as Mali and Chad, where violence is common. It is also likely to increase scrutiny of the U.S.’ military presence in Africa, which has come under increased criticism in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="Did-Army-Sergeant-Use-Blackjack-to-Kill-2-Civilians-in-Niger"><a href="#Did-Army-Sergeant-Use-Blackjack-to-Kill-2-Civilians-in-Niger" class="headerlink" title="Did Army Sergeant Use Blackjack to Kill 2 Civilians in Niger?"></a>Did Army Sergeant Use Blackjack to Kill 2 Civilians in Niger?</h1><p>On October 4, 2017, Staff Sergeant Bryan C. Black was killed in an ambush in Niger with fellow soldiers Sergeant La David Johnson, Staff Sergeant Dustin Wright and Corporal Jeremiah Johnson. Initial reports from the Pentagon were that the casualties occurred when their unit came under attack by 50-100 militants.</p>
<p>In December of 2017, a report surfaced in the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Mail that alleged that Black used his blackjack to kill two unarmed civilians near the village of Tongo Tongo before the ambush. This story has not been confirmed by any other news outlet and the Pentagon has not released any information regarding possible motive for the attack.</p>
<p>If true, this would not be the first time that a U.S. soldier has been involved in a war crime. In 2012, Staff Sergeant Robert Bales was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder for killing unarmed Afghan civilians during a night raid on their village. Bales was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>
<p>The Niger ambush has become a controversial topic in the United States, with some politicians calling for an investigation into what went wrong and others insisting that it is time to move on. The father of La David Johnson has accused President Trump of being insensitive during a phone call he made to console him after his son’s death.</p>
<p>The incident is also raising questions about the role of American troops in Africa. The United States currently has around 6,000 troops stationed in Africa, most of them operating in Djibouti and Somalia. While American soldiers are not engaged in combat operations against ISIS or al-Qaeda militants in Africa, they are training local forces and providing support for counter-terrorism operations.</p>
<h1 id="Questions-Raised-After-U-S-Soldier-Found-with-Blackjack-in-Niger"><a href="#Questions-Raised-After-U-S-Soldier-Found-with-Blackjack-in-Niger" class="headerlink" title="Questions Raised After U.S. Soldier Found with Blackjack in Niger"></a>Questions Raised After U.S. Soldier Found with Blackjack in Niger</h1><p>A U.S. soldier who was recently found with a blackjack in the African country of Niger has raised questions among senior military officials about the role of American forces in the region. The soldier, who has not been identified, was discovered with the weapon during a search of his quarters by local police.</p>
<p>Officials are now investigating whether or not the soldier was authorized to possess the blackjack, which is considered a prohibited weapon under military regulations. Possession of a blackjack can result in disciplinary action, including termination from the military.</p>
<p>The incident has also sparked questions about the role of American troops in Niger and neighboring countries, where they have been deployed as part of Operation Juniper Micron aimed at combating terrorism. In particular, some lawmakers are asking why U.S. soldiers are stationed in such a remote and dangerous region.</p>
<p>The soldier’s discovery with the blackjack comes just weeks after four U.S. soldiers were killed during an ambush by militants in Niger. The attack raised concerns about the safety of U.S. troops stationed in Africa and led to calls for more information about the mission in Niger.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary James Mattis has defended the deployment of troops to Africa, saying that they are “ conducting vital missions to protect our citizens and allies.” He added that he is “ fully confident” in their ability to carry out their missions safely.</p>
<h1 id="American-Soldier-Allegedly-Murdered-Two-Civilians-with-a-Blackjack-in-Niger"><a href="#American-Soldier-Allegedly-Murdered-Two-Civilians-with-a-Blackjack-in-Niger" class="headerlink" title="American Soldier Allegedly Murdered Two Civilians with a Blackjack in Niger"></a>American Soldier Allegedly Murdered Two Civilians with a Blackjack in Niger</h1><p>On October 4, 2017, the Pentagon press secretary announced that three U.S. Army soldiers were killed and two were wounded in an ambush in Niger. The Department of Defense (DoD) initially reported that the soldiers were killed in a firefight with militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). A month later, on November 6, 2017, the DoD announced that one of the slain soldiers was actually murdered by another U.S. soldier with a blackjack.[1]</p>
<p>The murder allegedly took place after the firefight had ended and the militants had fled. The accused soldier was part of a team that was providing security for a joint U.S.-Nigerian reconnaissance patrol when the incident occurred. He has been identified as Sergeant La David Johnson, 25, of Miami Gardens, Florida.[2]</p>
<p>According to officials, Johnson was allegedly killed by Sgt. Bryan C. Black, 35, of Puyallup, Washington; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; and Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, 29, of Lyons, Georgia.[3] All four soldiers were members of 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne).[4]</p>
<p>The Pentagon has not released many details about the incident, but it is believed that Black struck Johnson with a blackjack after he became unresponsive following his exposure to hostile fire.[5] Wright was also killed in the attack, and Jeremiah Johnson and Black were wounded.[6]</p>
<p>Black has been charged with unpremeditated murder and is currently being held at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.[7] He has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.[8] The other two soldiers involved in the attack have not yet been charged with any crimes.[9]</p>
<p>Johnson’s body was returned to Miami Gardens on October 17th and he was buried with full military honors on October 21st.[10] More than 1,200 people attended his funeral, including Representative Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), who criticized President Donald Trump for his disrespectful handling of Johnson’s death.[11]</p>
<p>In early October 2017 news circulated about three Green Berets being killed while on patrol in Niger but what wasn’t told until later is one these soldiers died as a result of an alleged assault by another American soldier using a blackjack .  In November Sergeant La David Johnson’s murderer Sgt . Bryan C . Black had his day in military court where he plead not guilty to unpremeditated murder charges .  It’s still unclear what provoked Black to kill Johnson or why he used such a brutal weapon but what is known is this story doesn’t end there .  Staff Sgt . Jeremiah W . Johnson and Sgt . Dustin M . Wright both lost their lives during that fateful ambush as well leaving behind grieving families and communities back home waiting for answers .</p>
