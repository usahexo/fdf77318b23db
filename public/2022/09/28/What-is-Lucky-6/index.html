<h1 id="How-to-play-Lucky-6"><a href="#How-to-play-Lucky-6" class="headerlink" title="How to play Lucky 6?"></a>How to play Lucky 6?</h1><p>Lucky 6 is an online casino game that is played with six dice. The aim of the game is to score points by rolling certain combinations of dice. Players can wager on the outcome of each roll, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-play"><a href="#How-to-play" class="headerlink" title="How to play"></a>How to play</h2><p>To play Lucky 6, you need six dice and a pen and paper to keep score. The first player rolls all six dice and sets them aside. They then select any two dice and add their total together. This number is recorded as the player’s first point. The process is then repeated for the next two dice, and so on. If a player rolls doubles (e.g. two ones), they score four points instead of two.</p>
<p>The player keeps rolling until they either roll a double or fail to add any more points to their total. Once they have finished rolling, they set the dice aside and select another pair to add together. If they roll doubles again, they score eight points instead of four. The player continues adding pairs until they either roll doubles for the third time (scoring 16 points) or fail to add any more points (at which point their score is recorded).</p>
<p>The game then proceeds to the next player clockwise who repeats the same process, starting with their first point. The aim is to score as many points as possible before scoring a double three times (at which point you lose). The winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the game.</p>
