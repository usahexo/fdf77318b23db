#  Siloam Springs Set To Raise The Legal Gambling Age

The city of Siloam Springs is set to raise the legal gambling age from 18 to 21. The proposal, which was first introduced by Ward 2 Councilman Jerry John, would amend the city's existing ordinance that regulates the use of gaming machines in the city.

"I believe it is important that we raise the legal gambling age in our city," said John in a statement. "By doing so, we can help protect our citizens from the potential harms associated with gambling."

According to a study published by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), young people are particularly at risk for developing a gambling addiction. The study found that people aged 18 to 24 are more than twice as likely as adults 25 and older to develop a gambling problem.

"We need to take steps to protect our young people from the dangers of gambling," continued John. "This ordinance will help do just that."

The proposed amendment will be discussed at a future meeting of the Siloam Springs City Council.

#  Gambling Age In Siloam Springs To Rise To 21

The city of Siloam Springs will soon raise the gambling age from 18 to 21. This decision was made in an effort to help better protect citizens and reduce gambling-related problems, such as addiction and crime.

City officials say they have seen a growing problem with gambling among Siloam Springs’ youth in recent years. And while they understand that many young people are responsible when it comes to gambling, they feel that raising the age limit is the best way to help reduce potential harm.

According to data from the Arkansas Department of Human Services, the number of Siloam Springs residents ages 18-21 who have problem gambling issues has increased dramatically in recent years. In 2013, there were only 5 cases reported. But by 2017, that number had jumped to 67 cases.

This data is just one factor that influenced the decision to raise the gambling age in Siloam Springs. City officials also considered studies which show that younger people are more likely to develop addictions to gambling, and that increasing the age limit can help reduce crime rates associated with gambling.

There has been some backlash against the decision to raise the gambling age, with some people arguing that it will simply push young people into black market or illegal activities. But city officials remain confident that this is the right decision for Siloam Springs, and they look forward to seeing positive results from it.

#  Siloam Springs Raises The Legal Gambling Age To 21

The small city of Siloam Springs, Arkansas, located in the northwest corner of the state, has decided to raise the legal gambling age from 18 to 21. The change will go into effect on November 1st.

Supporters of the measure feel that it will help to protect young people from addiction and other negative consequences associated with gambling. They note that Siloam Springs is located in a very rural area, and that there is a lack of elsewhere to gamble legally in the area.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will simply push gambling activity underground, and that young people will be more likely to engage in risky behavior when they have to do so clandestinely. They also maintain that 18 is an age at which people are considered legally adults and should be able to make their own decisions about whether or not to gamble.

The new law does not apply to casinos or racetracks, but does cover lotteries, bingo, and other forms of casino-like gambling. It is not clear what effect the measure will have on Siloam Springs’s local economy, but it is likely that some residents who currently gamble at 18 will travel to neighboring towns in order to do so.

The vote was 5-2 with Ward 2 Councilor Bev Robinson and Ward 4 Councilor Don Hutchings voting against the measure.

The new ordinance will take effect in 30 days.

Ward 1 Councilor Rusty James said he sponsored the measure because there is a perception that Siloam Springs is a haven for underage gambling.

Siloam Springs, a city in northwest Arkansas, is considering raising the legal gambling age from 18 to 21. The proposal was brought forth by Alderman Jim Webb and seconded by Mayor David Wilkins.

Webb said that the change is needed to help protect young people and vulnerable adults from being taken advantage of by the gambling industry.

“The main reason we are looking at this ordinance is because our state Legislature has not done anything to address this issue at all,” Webb said.

Webb added that there is a lot of lobbying going on in the state capital to keep the legal gambling age at 18. However, he believes that Siloam Springs has an opportunity to lead the way on this issue.

“I just think it sends the wrong message for our young people that we are the first place in the state of Arkansas that’s going to say it’s okay for you to drink at 18 but you can’t gamble until you’re 21,” he said.

Mayor Wilkins agrees with Webb’s assessment and says that he would like to see Siloam Springs be known as a community that cares about its young people.

If approved, the new ordinance would take effect on July 1, 2019.
