#  When Was the Picardie Pattern Baccarat Made? Thomas Alva Edison Invented It!

The Picardie Pattern Baccarat is a luxury table game that was first invented by Thomas Edison in 1891. The game quickly gained in popularity and became a regular pastime for the wealthy and elite. The unique design of the table and the gameplay mechanics make it a very exciting game to play.

The Picardie Pattern Baccarat table is rectangular with a green cloth Gaming surface. There are three betting areas on the surface, one for the Banker, one for the Player, and one for a Tie. There are also six oval-shaped recessed areas around the edge of the gaming surface which hold the cards. The deck of cards is placed face down in the middle of these areas, and each player is dealt two cards face up. 

The goal of the game is to get as close to nine as possible. Points are awarded for each card according to its value: 2 through 9 are worth face value; 10s and Jacks are worth 0 points; Queens are worth 1 point; Kings are worth 2 points; an Ace is worth 1 or 11 points, whichever results in a higher total score. If both players have card totals of exactly nine points, then it is called a “natural” and the hand is automatically over. The player with the highest total wins the hand. 

If one player has more than nine points while the other has less than nine points, then that player’s score is reduced to nine points. For example, if one player has ten points and the other has five points, then that player’s score would be reduced to nine points, making their total equal to their opponent’s score. The winning hand pays out even money on all bets except for a Tie bet, which pays out 8-to-1 . 

The Picardie Pattern Baccarat table was very popular during its time but eventually fell out of fashion. However, there has been a resurgence in recent years as people have started to appreciate its elegance and complex gameplay mechanics.
