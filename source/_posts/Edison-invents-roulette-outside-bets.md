#  Edison invents roulette outside bets

One of the most popular casino games is roulette. Roulette is a game that involves betting on where a ball will land after being spun around a wheel. There are many different types of bets that can be made, but the most common are inside bets and outside bets.

An inside bet is a bet that is placed on one of the numbered slots on the roulette table. These bets usually have higher payouts than outside bets, but the chances of winning are also lower. An outside bet is a bet that is placed on one of the boxes around the edge of the table. These bets usually have lower payouts than inside bets, but the chances of winning are higher.

A recent invention by Edison Casino has introduced a new type of bet to the game of roulette - the outside bet. This new type of bet allows players to wager on whether or not two specific numbers will be adjacent to each other on the roulette wheel. For example, a player could wager 10 dollars that number 17 and 18 will be next to each other on the wheel. If either number hits, the player would win 20 dollars (10 dollars for each number).

This new type of bet offers players more flexibility when it comes to betting, as they can now hedge their bets against multiple outcomes by betting on different combinations of numbers. It also allows players to take advantage of favourable odds without having to risk too much money.

#  Roulette outside bets explained by Edison

When you play roulette, you can place bets on a variety of different things. The inside bets are the bets that are placed on the numbered pockets on the roulette wheel, and these are generally more risky than the outside bets.

The outside bets are the bets that are placed on the areas of the table that aren't directly related to the numbered pockets. These include betting on red or black, odd or even, or betting on a range of numbers.

The odds for each of these bets are fairly straightforward. If you bet on red or black, then your odds are 50/50, as there are 18 red and 18 black numbers on the wheel. If you bet on odd or even, then your odds are again 50/50, as there are 18 even and 18 odd numbers. And if you bet on a range of numbers, then your odds will depend on the range that you choose.

One thing to remember with outside bets is that they always include the zero pocket. This is because there is one red number (number 26), two black numbers (numbers 3 and 12), and two even numbers (numbers 4 and 8) which all appear on the zero pocket. So if you're betting on red or black, then it's important to remember that number zero is also included in those totals.

Another thing to be aware of with outside bets is that they tend to have lower payouts than inside bets. So if you're looking for a high payout, then you might want to stick to inside bets instead.

#  How to make outside bets in roulette

There are a number of different types of bets that can be made when playing roulette. While the inside bets are more likely to result in a payout, they also offer lower odds. For players who are looking for a bigger potential payout, it is possible to make outside bets instead.

One of the most popular types of outside bets is the red or black bet. This is a wager on whether the next spin will result in a red or black number being called. The odds for this bet are even money, so players have a 50% chance of winning each time.

Another common type of outside bet is the odd or even wager. This is a bet on whether the next spin will result in an odd or even number being called. Like the red or black bet, this wager offers even odds and so has a 50% chance of winning each time.

Players can also make bets on specific numbers with outside bets. These include betting on whether the next number called will be low (1-18) or high (19-36), betting on two adjacent numbers, betting on three neighbouring numbers, or betting on four adjacent numbers. The odds for these kinds of bets vary depending on how many squares the player covers, but they generally offer better odds than either red/black or odd/even bets.

Outside bets can be a great way to increase your chances of winning while playing roulette, and they are easy to understand and place. So if you’re looking for a little extra excitement while playing this classic casino game, why not give some outside bets a try?

#  What are the odds of winning with outside bets in roulette?

When playing roulette, there are a variety of different betting options available to players. One of the most popular betting options is to make outside bets, which are bets placed on the areas of the table that are not part of the numbered grid. In this article, we will take a look at the odds of winning with outside bets in roulette.

There are a number of different outside bets that can be made in roulette, and each one has its own odds. The simplest type of outside bet is a bet on red or black. This bet is simply a wager on whether the next spin of the wheel will result in a red or black number being spun out. The odds of winning this bet are 1 in 2, or 50%.

Another simple outside bet is a bet on whether the next spin will result in a number that is higher or lower than the number that was spun out on the previous spin. This bet is known as an evens or odds bet, depending on which side of the equation you are betting on. The odds of winning this bet are also 1 in 2, or 50%.

A more complex outside bet is a column or dozen bet. This type of wager involves betting on one of three twelve-number groups located at either end of the grid on the roulette table. The odds for winning this type of wager vary depending on which dozen or column is selected, but typically range from 2:1 to 5:1.

The final type of popular outside bet is a colour/number combination wager. With this type of wager, players choose two numbers and then place a bet on whether both numbers will show up on the same spin or not. The odds for winning this type of wager vary depending on what numbers are selected, but generally stand at around 17:1.

#  Get tips from Edison on how to make money with outside bets in roulette

There is an element of luck involved in any casino game, but roulette in particular can be a very profitable venture with a little bit of strategy. One such strategy is to make so-called “outside bets”, which are wagers on specific portions of the roulette table rather than on a single number.

The payouts for outside bets are typically lower than those for betting on a single number, but the odds of winning are much higher. This makes them a more reliable way to make money in roulette, and they are recommended for beginners who are still learning the ropes of the game.

Here are some tips on how to make money with outside bets in roulette:

#1: Choose wisely

Not all outside bets are created equal – some offer better odds than others. The easiest way to maximise your chances of winning is to focus your bets on the most favourable options.

Some of the most favourable outside bets include betting on colours (red or black), betting on even or odd numbers, and betting on low or high numbers. There are also several other options available, so be sure to do your research before placing any wagers.

#2: Make multiple bets

Another way to increase your chances of winning is by making multiple bets at once. This involves betting on several different outcomes simultaneously, which increases your overall odds of winning something.

Just be careful not to bet too much money on any one bet, as you could quickly lose it all if you don’t win. A safer option is to spread your money out across several different bets.

#3: Wait for clear opportunities

It can be tempting to place a bet as soon as you see an opportunity, but it’s often wiser to wait for a clearer chance. Roulette is a game that involves a lot of luck, and you may not always get the best odds right away.

By waiting for better opportunities, you can minimise your risk and give yourself a better chance of winning money. If you feel confident about a certain bet, go ahead and place it – but don’t force anything just because the odds seem good enough.
