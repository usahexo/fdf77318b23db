#  How to Cash Your Winnings from an Internet Casino

There are a few important things you need to do before cashing out your winnings from an Internet casino. The first is to ensure that you have met the wagering requirements, if any. The second is to make sure that you have registered your winnings with the IRS. Finally, you will need to find a way to get your money from the casino.
